## 🛠️ **Installation** (Takes Just a Minute!)
Note: I'd love to put this on the Chrome Web Store, but Google wants $5 for a developer account, and frankly, I'd rather spend that on snacks. So, you’ll have to install it manually — but hey, that just makes you a developer too!😂🚀   
I'll take you through the steps:   
1️⃣ Clone this repo **or** download the ZIP file.   
2️⃣ Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.    
3️⃣ Enable **Developer Mode** (top-right corner).   
4️⃣ Click **"Load Unpacked"** and select the folder.   
5️⃣ Visit any Codeforces profile and explore their solved problems instantly!

## 🎯 **How It Works**

- Instantly see the **list of solved problems** along with submission links.  
- Click on any problem to **try solving it yourself!**  

No extra setup, no manual tracking—**just a quick way to stay updated and motivated.**

###### Developer's NOTE:   
I’ve created this project as a total newbie to web development (particularly extension development) to get a hands-on feel for how web development works. Along the way, I’ve quickly skimmed over HTML, CSS, JavaScript, working with APIs, and working with Chrome extensions, among other things.
